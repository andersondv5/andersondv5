🧑‍💻 Hey, I’m Anderson Silva (@andersondv5)

🚀 A Front-End Developer & UX/UI Designer, blending technology and creativity to craft sleek, responsive websites. I'm deeply passionate about user-centered design and always aim to build intuitive digital experiences.

🔭 Currently expanding my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while exploring cutting-edge UX principles to enhance interactivity and engagement.

💡 Open to collaborating on web development projects where performance, design, and user experience come together to create something amazing.

🖥️ Tech is my playground, and design is my tool to shape it. Always striving for clean code and compelling interfaces.

😎 Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I’m either tweaking my portfolio or diving into the latest design trends!
